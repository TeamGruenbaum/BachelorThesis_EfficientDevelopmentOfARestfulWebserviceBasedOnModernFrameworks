# Introduction
This repository contains our collaborative bachelor thesis from our bachelor studies at Hof University of Applied Sciences. It compares the advantages and disadvantages of different languages and frameworks for implementing RESTful webservices in German.

For this purpose, a specification for a fictitious RESTful web service for library management was written. Next, evaluation criteria were developed to later determine which framework is best suited in general or for specific use cases. Then, the specification was implemented using the following programming languages and frameworks, using only the functionality provided by the respective framework or explicitly recommended in the documentation, to really test the frameworks itself:
- C# with ASP.NET Core
- Java with Spring Boot
- TypeScript with Express.js
- Go with Gin
Finally, the implementations were rated against the previously established evaluation criteria and a conclusion was reached.

The [specification](https://teamgruenbaum.github.io/RESTfulFrameworksComparison/) and [code](https://github.com/TeamGruenbaum/RESTfulFrameworksComparison) can also be found on GitHub.
